# Text-Mining-and-Visualization
Sustainability is a thread that all successful energy companies must keep up with in the 21st century. The impetus for companies to pursue policies and practices that address social and environmental concerns has never been so strong, and corporate social responsibility in the energy sector is a critical differentiator between the industry pre- and post-crisis. The paper used text data to examine the role of the energy sector and its contribution to CSR. The paper revealed that all text data extracted from pdfs throw more light on the critical issues of CSR, but stakeholders in energy sector concentrated more on greenhouse gas emissions (GE) and employee health and safety (EHS), with less emphasis on customer welfare (CD) and diversity (D). Again, significant contributors to CSR are firms centred within the OECD territories compared to firms from African countries classified as LDC.
