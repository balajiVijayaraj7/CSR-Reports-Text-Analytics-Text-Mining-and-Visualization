# CSR Reports Text Analytics

## Introduction
Welcome to the CSR Reports Text Analytics repository. This project involves the analysis of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reports from various firms across different industries. The goal is to perform text analytics on these reports to provide meaningful insights into how firms address key CSR issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, diversity, employee health & safety, and customer welfare. The analysis aims to identify trends, patterns, and variations in CSR reporting over time, across different sectors, firm sizes, and countries.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of CSR reports from different industries, each named according to the company and publication year. The data points for each firm and year are stored in an RDS file named "GRIexcel.rds". Additionally, there are subfolders organized by industry, each containing CSR reports relevant to that sector.

## Tasks

### 1. Text Analytics on CSR Reports

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the text data to prepare it for analysis. This step may involve removing stopwords, punctuation, and other irrelevant information.

2. **Keyword Identification:** Identify keywords and phrases related to key CSR issues (greenhouse gas emissions, diversity, employee health & safety, and customer welfare) within the reports.

### 2. Insights and Interpretations

1. **Trends Over Time:** Analyze how the attention to key CSR issues has evolved over the years. Are there any noticeable trends or shifts in focus?

2. **Sector Analysis:** Examine how different industries address the key CSR issues. Do certain sectors prioritize certain issues more than others?

3. **Size and Country Analysis:** Investigate if there are differences in CSR reporting based on firm size and country of reporting. Are there any patterns based on these variables?

## Conclusion

The CSR Reports Text Analytics repository offers a structured approach to extracting meaningful insights from CSR reports across various industries. By applying text analytics techniques and examining trends, and keyword frequencies, this analysis aims to provide regulators with valuable information about how firms address key CSR issues over time and across different contexts.
